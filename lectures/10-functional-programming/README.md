## Notes
* Topic 1 - Functional Programming
    * "Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function.  Not a method.  Not a class.  Not a framework.  Just a function."
    * Scope
        * Basics of scoping
    * Closures
        * IIFE
        * Encapsulation
        * The Javascript Module Pattern
    * Declarative vs Imperative code
        * Provide examples of imperative coding
        * Provide examples of declarative programming - using JavaScript array methods like** map, filter**, and **reduce**
    * Stateless (Pure) functions
    * Immutability
        * Provide examples
    * First-class functions
    * **forEach**
        * Demonstrate** forEach** in conjunction with other array methods to filter large data sets

    * **map**
    * **reduce**
    * **filter**
    * Basics of working with the JavaScript** this** keyword
    * Demo - How
        * Use provided demo code to showcase how to filter through large sets of data
            1. Use the JavaScript console to debug and demonstrate
