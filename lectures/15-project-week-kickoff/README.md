**Additional topics related to final projects**

- General API craziness
- [CORS & JSONP](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/cors-and-jsonp.html) • [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) • [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
- Heroku requires [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) to access external sites
- Async issues... it'll happen to you!
- Reminder: [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en)
- The demo we did on the GitHub API would be useful if used as an API sandbox to quickly get data to log into the console or view in the DOM, wouldn't it?

**Overall schedule from here on (the following is a sample recommended breakdown to provide to students)**

- Friday lab time:
	- Discuss project possibilities with your team
	- Begin testing/experimenting with APIs
	- Apply for API access if required! This is important if your API requires a key/token/etc.
	- As your ideas are coming together, bounce things off SJ & Will to help manage project scope. Ideally these conversations can be held in group meetings with the entire team and all of the instructional staff, as much as possible

- Over the weekend
	- Continue reflecting on the scope of the project and what its MVP is
	- As needed, do any research into tech pieces or the problem domain
	- Maybe begin some wireframe sketches and/or problem domain diagrams
	- Do not forget to complete any lingering unfinished coursework by the Monday morning deadline
	- Do not forget the 401 exam which is due by 11:59pm Sunday night, and the two quizzes that you can take to help prepare (one of those quizzes is graded, the other is not)

- Monday morning
	- Get together with your team and complete the project proposal as outlined in the Day 16 README doc
	- Be sure to have a plan in place for your GitHub procedures within your team. Ideally this is written down or shared in a document as THE source of truth
	- In addition to the project itself, be sure to put together a plan for how your team will deconstruct it into tasks/TODO items
	- When your proposal is complete, meet with the instructional staff to get it reviewed and approved. After that you are ready to start building.

- Daily during project week
	- Standup meeting with instructional staff sometime during the morning
	- You should do at least one other standup with your team each day
	- You will have a daily report to fill out and submit in Canvas at the end of each day
- Presentation Day schedule is TBA as of right now. Once it is settled it will be communicated to you ASAP.
