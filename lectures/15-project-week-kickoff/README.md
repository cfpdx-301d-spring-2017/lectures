## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Today we'll review the topics we've covered in the past 3 weeks and then establish the guidelines for moving into project week!*

Song for the day: ["The Final Countdown" by Gabe The Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn5vJ0dhxXs)

- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) should be published late this afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday. It is a graded portion of this course, regardless of student intent to advance to a 401 course.

- Students should be reminded that the exam is open-book, open-Google, open-Stack_Overflow, whatever resources they want to use. The exam is designed to be, in spots, a little bit beyond what has been covered. The intent in those spots is to measure resourcefulness and ability to adapt and figure something out. Remind students to give themselves adequate time for the exam: 1-2 hours depending if they are fast or slow on these kinds of things.

- Per usual, there will be a blackout on completing coursework during Project Week. Students should have all lingering unfinished coursework submitted by no later than Monday morning at 8:59am.

- Note that any unsubmitted assignments will be marked as a (temporary) zero by Monday. This is not punitive nor permanent: it is meant to be informative to show students where their course grade would stand if they never submit those assignments.

- To get any late work (or resubmits for higher grades) turned in after project week, make a plan for that with the instructor and/or the Admissions team so they know what students are working on, and when. Importantly, be aware of how this work progress and grades overlap with admissions requirements and deadlines for upcoming 401 courses. This is especially crititcal when enrollments are running high and there are possible waitlists for upcoming 401s.

**Review of the course**

- Weekly concepts and daily topics
- Where were we at the end of 201?
	- (can be fun to show some of their 201 final projects here)

**Any requested topics for more specific review? Let's make a list!**

- (topic 1?)
- (topic 2?)
- (topic 3?)

**Continue with specific review topics as requested...**

**Final projects: Let's go over the requirements!**

- Day [16](../16-project-week-day-1/README.md): Getting started
- Day [17](../17-project-week-day-2/README.md): Big buildout day
- Day [18](../18-project-week-day-3/README.md): Aim for MVP
- Day [19](../19-project-week-day-4/README.md): Stretch goals, refinements
- Day [20](../19-project-week-day-4/README.md): Presentations! `Note: project requirements are in this document`
- Do not forget the associated Canvas assignments! One is a group submission and the other is an individual submission!

**Additional topics related to final projects**

- General API craziness
- [CORS & JSONP](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/cors-and-jsonp.html) • [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) • [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
- Heroku requires [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) to access external sites
- Async issues... it'll happen to you!
- Reminder: [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en)
- Reminder: [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- The demo we did on the GitHub API would be useful if repurposed as an API sandbox to quickly get data to log into the console or view in the DOM, wouldn't it?

**Overall schedule from here on (the following is a sample recommended breakdown to provide to students)**

- Friday lab time:
	- Discuss project possibilities with your team
	- Begin testing/experimenting with APIs
	- Apply for API access if required! This is important if your API requires a key/token/etc.
	- As your ideas are coming together, bounce things off Sam & TAs to help manage project scope. Ideally these conversations can be held in group meetings with the entire team and all of the instructional staff, as much as possible

- Over the weekend
	- Continue reflecting on the scope of the project and what its MVP is
	- As needed, do any research into tech pieces or the problem domain
	- Maybe begin some wireframe sketches and/or problem domain diagrams
	- Do not forget to complete any lingering unfinished coursework by the Monday morning deadline
	- Do not forget the 401 exam which is due by 11:59pm Sunday night, and the two quizzes that you can take to help prepare (one of those quizzes is graded, the other is not)

- Monday morning
	- Get together with your team and complete the project proposal as outlined in the Day 16 README doc
	- Be sure to have a plan in place for your GitHub procedures within your team. Ideally this is written down or shared in a document as THE source of truth
	- In addition to the project itself, be sure to put together a plan for how your team will deconstruct it into tasks/TODO items
	- When your proposal is complete, meet with the instructional staff to get it reviewed and approved. After that you are ready to start building.

- Daily during project week
	- Standup meeting with instructional staff sometime during the morning
	- You should do at least one other standup with your team each day
	- You will have a daily report to fill out and submit in Canvas at the end of each day
	- Sam (except for one-on-one meeting times and any other regular CF meetings) and some subset of the TAs will be available to you between 9:00a and 6:00p each day.
- Presentation Day schedule is TBA as of right now. Once it is settled it will be communicated to you ASAP.

## Lab
<!-- Provide a link to the daily lab README in the Labs directory, and review this document as part of the lecture -->
There are no new lab assignment for this day, since it is primarily a review/transition day.
