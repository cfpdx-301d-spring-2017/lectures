# Class 19 -  Project Week: Milestone 4

Overview

***By the end of Day 4, students should have their application fully completed and deployed.  Students will likely want to work on additional features or bug fixes, yet, it should be made clear that these updates should exist on their own feature or hotfix branches and **should not **be merged into master.***

## Presentation Prep

1. Test your presentation:
 * As your teams now have MVP in place and are focusing more on layout, design, and stretch goals today, take a few minutes at some point to go to the classroom and take a look at your app on the projector/screen setup. You'll be glad you did. It's often a moment of, "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!"

2. Plan your presentation:
    * Please introduce yourself at the beginning of your presentation. A simple "Hi, I'm X" will do. Not everyone in the audience will know your name.
    * Structure your presentation into two sections:
        1. Demo your app (around 10 minutes)
            * **Each person** on the team should demo and talk about one part of the app
            * Show us what your app can do, don't tell us!
        2. Talk about the tech (10-15 minutes)
            * **Each person** on the team should have a specific topic to talk about. 
            * You can talk about some CSS you wrote, or a function you're proud of, or a challenge you conquered.
            * Do **not** wing this. Have something in mind before presenting and know what you want to say.
            * Showing code is not mandatory, but if you do, don't walk us line by line. 
    * Each team member needs to contribute and talk during each section. You all put a lot of hard into your project and now's the time to talk about what you did and what you learned.

3. Rehearse your presentation:
 * Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics.

## Class 19 Learning Objectives
