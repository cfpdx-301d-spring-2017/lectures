## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

- During this class, you will focus on teaching students the underlying concepts of how the web works and all of the associated terminology.

- Starting with an introduction to the WRRC (web request response cycle), you will demonstrate how HTTP works and how to accomplish simple GET requests through the use of jQuery.

- Students will need to understand the 3 major parts of every request (url, method, headers) and the 3 major parts of every response (status, headers, body) and also use live-server or equivalent to receive the full benefits.

- You can demonstrate these concepts directly in the browser and talk through debugging techniques by showing the WRRC components, in real time, in the "Network" tab of Chromeâ€™s developer tools.

- Discuss what AJAX is and how it works, the different AJAX options offered by jQuery, and how AJAX can be used to load locally-stored JSON, which is what is happening in today's lab.

- By Wednesday, students will be seeing a server that updates a PostgreSQL database, so, things are about to start happening fast. A solid foundation today is critical to the success of the entire week.

- Note that the content of the blog has completely changed from where it was on Day 5, and is now being loaded from data/hackerIpsom.json. There is some new functionality added to article.js to handle the AJAX call, and also caching the results into local storage.

- One more thing: ES2015 syntax for variable declarations! `let` and `const` join the party.
